# [name]

An 3D arrow object for visualizing directions.

## Code Example

  
```ts  
const dir = new THREE.Vector3( 1, 2, 0 );  
  
//normalize the direction vector (convert to vector of length 1)  
dir.normalize();  
  
const origin = new THREE.Vector3( 0, 0, 0 );  
const length = 1;  
const hex = 0xffff00;  
  
const arrowHelper = new THREE.ArrowHelper( dir, origin, length, hex );  
scene.add( arrowHelper );  
```  

## Examples

[example:webgl_shadowmesh WebGL / shadowmesh]

## Constructor

###  [name]([param:Vector3 dir], [param:Vector3 origin], [param:Number
length], [param:Number hex], [param:Number headLength], [param:Number
headWidth] )

[page:Vector3 dir] -- direction from origin. Must be a unit vector.  
[page:Vector3 origin] -- Point at which the arrow starts.  
[page:Number length] -- length of the arrow. Default is `1`.  
[page:Number hex] -- hexadecimal value to define color. Default is 0xffff00.  
[page:Number headLength] -- The length of the head of the arrow. Default is
`0.2` * length.  
[page:Number headWidth] -- The width of the head of the arrow. Default is
`0.2` * headLength.  

## Properties

See the base [page:Object3D] class for common properties.

### <br/> Line line; <br/>

Contains the line part of the arrowHelper.

### <br/> Mesh cone; <br/>

Contains the cone part of the arrowHelper.

## Methods

See the base [page:Object3D] class for common methods.

### [method:undefined setColor]([param:Color color])

color -- The desired color.  
  
Sets the color of the arrowHelper.

###  [method:undefined setLength]([param:Number length], [param:Number
headLength], [param:Number headWidth])

length -- The desired length.  
headLength -- The length of the head of the arrow.  
headWidth -- The width of the head of the arrow.  
  
Sets the length of the arrowhelper.

### [method:undefined setDirection]([param:Vector3 dir])

dir -- The desired direction. Must be a unit vector.  
  
Sets the direction of the arrowhelper.

### [method:undefined dispose]()

Frees the GPU-related resources allocated by this instance. Call this method
whenever this instance is no longer used in your app.
