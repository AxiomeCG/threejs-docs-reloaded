# [name]

This is the base class for most objects in three.js and provides a set of
properties and methods for manipulating objects in 3D space.  
  
Note that this can be used for grouping objects via the [page:.add]( object )
method which adds the object as a child, however it is better to use
[page:Group] for this.

## Constructor

### [name]()

The constructor takes no arguments.

## Properties

### <br/> AnimationClip animations; <br/>

Array with object's animation clips.

### <br/> Boolean castShadow; <br/>

Whether the object gets rendered into shadow map. Default is `false`.

### <br/> Array children; <br/>

Array with object's children. See [page:Group] for info on manually grouping
objects.

### <br/> Material customDepthMaterial; <br/>

Custom depth material to be used when rendering to the depth map. Can only be
used in context of meshes. When shadow-casting with a [page:DirectionalLight]
or [page:SpotLight], if you are modifying vertex positions in the vertex
shader you must specify a customDepthMaterial for proper shadows. Default is
`undefined`.

### <br/> Material customDistanceMaterial; <br/>

Same as [page:.customDepthMaterial customDepthMaterial], but used with
[page:PointLight]. Default is `undefined`.

### <br/> Boolean frustumCulled; <br/>

When this is set, it checks every frame if the object is in the frustum of the
camera before rendering the object. If set to `false` the object gets rendered
every frame even if it is not in the frustum of the camera. Default is `true`.

### <br/> Integer id; <br/>

readonly â€“ Unique number for this object instance.

### <br/> Boolean isObject3D; <br/>

Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].

### <br/> Layers layers; <br/>

The layer membership of the object. The object is only visible if it has at
least one layer in common with the [page:Camera] in use. This property can
also be used to filter out unwanted objects in ray-intersection tests when
using [page:Raycaster].

### <br/> Matrix4 matrix; <br/>

The local transform matrix.

### <br/> Boolean matrixAutoUpdate; <br/>

When this is set, it calculates the matrix of position, (rotation or
quaternion) and scale every frame and also recalculates the matrixWorld
property. Default is [page:Object3D.DEFAULT_MATRIX_AUTO_UPDATE] (true).

### <br/> Matrix4 matrixWorld; <br/>

The global transform of the object. If the Object3D has no parent, then it's
identical to the local transform [page:.matrix].

### <br/> Boolean matrixWorldAutoUpdate; <br/>

If set, then the renderer checks every frame if the object and its children
need matrix updates. When it isn't, then you have to maintain all matrices in
the object and its children yourself. Default is
[page:Object3D.DEFAULT_MATRIX_WORLD_AUTO_UPDATE] (true).

### <br/> Boolean matrixWorldNeedsUpdate; <br/>

When this is set, it calculates the matrixWorld in that frame and resets this
property to false. Default is `false`.

### <br/> Matrix4 modelViewMatrix; <br/>

This is passed to the shader and used to calculate the position of the object.

### <br/> String name; <br/>

Optional name of the object (doesn't need to be unique). Default is an empty
string.

### <br/> Matrix3 normalMatrix; <br/>

This is passed to the shader and used to calculate lighting for the object. It
is the transpose of the inverse of the upper left 3x3 sub-matrix of this
object's modelViewMatrix.  
  
The reason for this special matrix is that simply using the modelViewMatrix
could result in a non-unit length of normals (on scaling) or in a non-
perpendicular direction (on non-uniform scaling).  
  
On the other hand the translation part of the modelViewMatrix is not relevant
for the calculation of normals. Thus a Matrix3 is sufficient.

### <br/> Function onAfterRender; <br/>

An optional callback that is executed immediately after a 3D object is
rendered. This function is called with the following parameters: renderer,
scene, camera, geometry, material, group.

Please notice that this callback is only executed for `renderable` 3D objects.
Meaning 3D objects which define their visual appearance with geometries and
materials like instances of [page:Mesh], [page:Line], [page:Points] or
[page:Sprite]. Instances of [page:Object3D], [page:Group] or [page:Bone] are
not renderable and thus this callback is not executed for such objects.

### <br/> Function onBeforeRender; <br/>

An optional callback that is executed immediately before a 3D object is
rendered. This function is called with the following parameters: renderer,
scene, camera, geometry, material, group.

Please notice that this callback is only executed for `renderable` 3D objects.
Meaning 3D objects which define their visual appearance with geometries and
materials like instances of [page:Mesh], [page:Line], [page:Points] or
[page:Sprite]. Instances of [page:Object3D], [page:Group] or [page:Bone] are
not renderable and thus this callback is not executed for such objects.

### <br/> Object3D parent; <br/>

Object's parent in the [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph scene
graph]. An object can have at most one parent.

### <br/> Vector3 position; <br/>

A [page:Vector3] representing the object's local position. Default is `(0, 0,
0)`.

### <br/> Quaternion quaternion; <br/>

Object's local rotation as a [page:Quaternion Quaternion].

### <br/> Boolean receiveShadow; <br/>

Whether the material receives shadows. Default is `false`.

### <br/> Number renderOrder; <br/>

This value allows the default rendering order of
[link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph scene graph] objects to be
overridden although opaque and transparent objects remain sorted
independently. When this property is set for an instance of [page:Group
Group], all descendants objects will be sorted and rendered together. Sorting
is from lowest to highest renderOrder. Default value is `0`.

### <br/> Euler rotation; <br/>

Object's local rotation (see [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles
Euler angles]), in radians.

### <br/> Vector3 scale; <br/>

The object's local scale. Default is [page:Vector3]( 1, 1, 1 ).

### <br/> Vector3 up; <br/>

This is used by the [page:.lookAt lookAt] method, for example, to determine
the orientation of the result.  
Default is [page:Object3D.DEFAULT_UP] - that is, `( 0, 1, 0 )`.

### <br/> Object userData; <br/>

An object that can be used to store custom data about the Object3D. It should
not hold references to functions as these will not be cloned.

### <br/> String uuid; <br/>

[link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier UUID] of this
object instance. This gets automatically assigned, so this shouldn't be
edited.

### <br/> Boolean visible; <br/>

Object gets rendered if `true`. Default is `true`.

## Static Properties

Static properties and methods are defined per class rather than per instance
of that class. This means that changing [page:Object3D.DEFAULT_UP] or
[page:Object3D.DEFAULT_MATRIX_AUTO_UPDATE] will change the values of [page:.up
up] and [page:.matrixAutoUpdate matrixAutoUpdate] for `every` instance of
Object3D (or derived classes) created after the change has been made (already
created Object3Ds will not be affected).

### <br/> Vector3 DEFAULT_UP; <br/>

The default [page:.up up] direction for objects, also used as the default
position for [page:DirectionalLight], [page:HemisphereLight] and
[page:Spotlight] (which creates lights shining from the top down).  
Set to ( 0, 1, 0 ) by default.

### <br/> Boolean DEFAULT_MATRIX_AUTO_UPDATE; <br/>

The default setting for [page:.matrixAutoUpdate matrixAutoUpdate] for newly
created Object3Ds.  

### <br/> Boolean DEFAULT_MATRIX_WORLD_AUTO_UPDATE; <br/>

The default setting for [page:.matrixWorldAutoUpdate matrixWorldAutoUpdate]
for newly created Object3Ds.
