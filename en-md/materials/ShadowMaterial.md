# ShadowMaterial

This material can receive shadows, but otherwise is completely transparent.

## Code Example

  
```ts  
const geometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry( 2000, 2000 ); geometry.rotateX( -
Math.PI / 2 ); const material = new THREE.ShadowMaterial(); material.opacity =
0.2; const plane = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material ); plane.position.y =
-200; plane.receiveShadow = true; scene.add( plane );  
```  

## Examples
