# [name]

This material can receive shadows, but otherwise is completely transparent.

## Code Example

  
```ts  
const geometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry( 2000, 2000 );  
geometry.rotateX( - Math.PI / 2 );  
  
const material = new THREE.ShadowMaterial();  
material.opacity = 0.2;  
  
const plane = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );  
plane.position.y = -200;  
plane.receiveShadow = true;  
scene.add( plane );  
```
