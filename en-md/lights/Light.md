[page:Object3D] â†’

# [name]

Abstract base class for lights - all other light types inherit the properties
and methods described here.

## Constructor

### [name]( [param:Integer color], [param:Float intensity] )

[page:Integer color] - (optional) hexadecimal color of the light. Default is
0xffffff (white).  
[page:Float intensity] - (optional) numeric value of the light's
strength/intensity. Default is `1`.  
  
Creates a new [name]. Note that this is not intended to be called directly
(use one of derived classes instead).

## Properties

See the base [page:Object3D Object3D] class for common properties.

### <br/> Color color; <br/>

Color of the light. Defaults to a new [page:Color] set to white, if not passed
in the constructor.  

### <br/> Float intensity; <br/>

The light's intensity, or strength.  
When [page:WebGLRenderer.useLegacyLights legacy lighting mode] is disabled,
the units of intensity depend on the type of light.  
Default - `1.0`.

### <br/> Boolean isLight; <br/>

Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type [name].

## Methods

See the base [page:Object3D Object3D] class for common methods.

### [method:undefined dispose]()

Abstract dispose method for classes that extend this class; implemented by
subclasses that have disposable GPU-related resources.

### <br/> function copy( source: Light ): copy; <br/>

Copies the value of [page:.color color] and [page:.intensity intensity] from
the [page:Light source] light into this one.

### [method:Object toJSON]( [param:Object meta] )

meta -- object containing metadata such as materials, textures for objects.
