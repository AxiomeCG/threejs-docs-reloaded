# Vector3

Class representing a 3D [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space
vector]. A 3D vector is an ordered triplet of numbers (labeled x, y, and z),
which can be used to represent a number of things, such as:

  * A point in 3D space.
  * A direction and length in 3D space. In three.js the length will always be the [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance Euclidean distance] (straight-line distance) from `(0, 0, 0)` to `(x, y, z)` and the direction is also measured from `(0, 0, 0)` towards `(x, y, z)`.
  * Any arbitrary ordered triplet of numbers.

There are other things a 3D vector can be used to represent, such as momentum
vectors and so on, however these are the most common uses in three.js.

Iterating through a Vector3 instance will yield its components `(x, y, z)` in
the corresponding order.

## Code Example

  
```ts  
const a = new THREE.Vector3( 0, 1, 0 ); //no arguments; will be initialised to
(0, 0, 0) const b = new THREE.Vector3( ); const d = a.distanceTo( b );  
```
