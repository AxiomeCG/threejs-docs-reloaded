# OctahedronGeometry

A class for generating an octahedron geometry.

## Constructor

###  function OctahedronGeometry( radius: Float, detail: Integer ): void;

radius — Radius of the octahedron. Default is `1`.  
detail — Default is `0`. Setting this to a value greater than zero add
vertices making it no longer an octahedron.

## Properties

See the base [page:PolyhedronGeometry] class for common properties.

###  Object parameters;

An object with a property for each of the constructor parameters. Any
modification after instantiation does not change the geometry.

## Methods

See the base [page:PolyhedronGeometry] class for common methods.
