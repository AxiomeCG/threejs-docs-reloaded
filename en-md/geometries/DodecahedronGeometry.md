# DodecahedronGeometry

A class for generating a dodecahedron geometries.

## Constructor

###  function DodecahedronGeometry( radius: Float, detail: Integer ): void;

radius — Radius of the dodecahedron. Default is `1`.  
detail — Default is `0`. Setting this to a value greater than `0` adds
vertices making it no longer a dodecahedron.

## Properties

See the base [page:PolyhedronGeometry] class for common properties.

###  Object parameters;

An object with a property for each of the constructor parameters. Any
modification after instantiation does not change the geometry.

## Methods

See the base [page:PolyhedronGeometry] class for common methods.
