# [name]

A class for generating a tetrahedron geometries.

## Constructor

### [name]([param:Float radius], [param:Integer detail])

radius — Radius of the tetrahedron. Default is `1`.  
detail — Default is `0`. Setting this to a value greater than `0` adds
vertices making it no longer a tetrahedron.

## Properties

See the base [page:PolyhedronGeometry] class for common properties.

### <br/> Object parameters; <br/>

An object with a property for each of the constructor parameters. Any
modification after instantiation does not change the geometry.

## Methods

See the base [page:PolyhedronGeometry] class for common methods.
