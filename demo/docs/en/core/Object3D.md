# Object3D

This is the base class for most objects in three.js and provides a set of
properties and methods for manipulating objects in 3D space.  
  
Note that this can be used for grouping objects via the [.add](#)( object )
method which adds the object as a child, however it is better to use
[Group](en\objects\Group.html) for this.

## Constructor

### Object3D

  
  
```ts  
function Object3D( ): void;  
```  

The constructor takes no arguments.

## Properties

### animations

  
  
```ts  
animations: AnimationClip;  
```  

Array with object's animation clips.

### castShadow

  
  
```ts  
castShadow: Boolean;  
```  

Whether the object gets rendered into shadow map. Default is `false`.

### children

  
  
```ts  
children: Array;  
```  

Array with object's children. See [Group](en\objects\Group.html) for info on
manually grouping objects.

### customDepthMaterial

  
  
```ts  
customDepthMaterial: Material;  
```  

Custom depth material to be used when rendering to the depth map. Can only be
used in context of meshes. When shadow-casting with a
[DirectionalLight](en\lights\DirectionalLight.html) or
[SpotLight](en\lights\SpotLight.html), if you are modifying vertex positions
in the vertex shader you must specify a customDepthMaterial for proper
shadows. Default is `undefined`.

### customDistanceMaterial

  
  
```ts  
customDistanceMaterial: Material;  
```  

Same as [.customDepthMaterial](#customDepthMaterial), but used with
[PointLight](en\lights\PointLight.html). Default is `undefined`.

### frustumCulled

  
  
```ts  
frustumCulled: Boolean;  
```  

When this is set, it checks every frame if the object is in the frustum of the
camera before rendering the object. If set to `false` the object gets rendered
every frame even if it is not in the frustum of the camera. Default is `true`.

### id

  
  
```ts  
id: Integer;  
```  

readonly â€“ Unique number for this object instance.

### isObject3D

  
  
```ts  
isObject3D: Boolean;  
```  

Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type Object3D.

### layers

  
  
```ts  
layers: Layers;  
```  

The layer membership of the object. The object is only visible if it has at
least one layer in common with the [Camera](en\cameras\Camera.html) in use.
This property can also be used to filter out unwanted objects in ray-
intersection tests when using [Raycaster](en\core\Raycaster.html).

### matrix

  
  
```ts  
matrix: Matrix4;  
```  

The local transform matrix.

### matrixAutoUpdate

  
  
```ts  
matrixAutoUpdate: Boolean;  
```  

When this is set, it calculates the matrix of position, (rotation or
quaternion) and scale every frame and also recalculates the matrixWorld
property. Default is [Object3D.DEFAULT_MATRIX_AUTO_UPDATE](#) (true).

### matrixWorld

  
  
```ts  
matrixWorld: Matrix4;  
```  

The global transform of the object. If the Object3D has no parent, then it's
identical to the local transform [.matrix](#).

### matrixWorldAutoUpdate

  
  
```ts  
matrixWorldAutoUpdate: Boolean;  
```  

If set, then the renderer checks every frame if the object and its children
need matrix updates. When it isn't, then you have to maintain all matrices in
the object and its children yourself. Default is
[Object3D.DEFAULT_MATRIX_WORLD_AUTO_UPDATE](#) (true).

### matrixWorldNeedsUpdate

  
  
```ts  
matrixWorldNeedsUpdate: Boolean;  
```  

When this is set, it calculates the matrixWorld in that frame and resets this
property to false. Default is `false`.

### modelViewMatrix

  
  
```ts  
modelViewMatrix: Matrix4;  
```  

This is passed to the shader and used to calculate the position of the object.

### name

  
  
```ts  
name: String;  
```  

Optional name of the object (doesn't need to be unique). Default is an empty
string.

### normalMatrix

  
  
```ts  
normalMatrix: Matrix3;  
```  

This is passed to the shader and used to calculate lighting for the object. It
is the transpose of the inverse of the upper left 3x3 sub-matrix of this
object's modelViewMatrix.  
  
The reason for this special matrix is that simply using the modelViewMatrix
could result in a non-unit length of normals (on scaling) or in a non-
perpendicular direction (on non-uniform scaling).  
  
On the other hand the translation part of the modelViewMatrix is not relevant
for the calculation of normals. Thus a Matrix3 is sufficient.

### onAfterRender

  
  
```ts  
onAfterRender: Function;  
```  

An optional callback that is executed immediately after a 3D object is
rendered. This function is called with the following parameters: renderer,
scene, camera, geometry, material, group.

Please notice that this callback is only executed for `renderable` 3D objects.
Meaning 3D objects which define their visual appearance with geometries and
materials like instances of [Mesh](en\objects\Mesh.html),
[Line](en\objects\Line.html), [Points](en\objects\Points.html) or
[Sprite](en\objects\Sprite.html). Instances of
[Object3D](en\core\Object3D.html), [Group](en\objects\Group.html) or
[Bone](en\objects\Bone.html) are not renderable and thus this callback is not
executed for such objects.

### onBeforeRender

  
  
```ts  
onBeforeRender: Function;  
```  

An optional callback that is executed immediately before a 3D object is
rendered. This function is called with the following parameters: renderer,
scene, camera, geometry, material, group.

Please notice that this callback is only executed for `renderable` 3D objects.
Meaning 3D objects which define their visual appearance with geometries and
materials like instances of [Mesh](en\objects\Mesh.html),
[Line](en\objects\Line.html), [Points](en\objects\Points.html) or
[Sprite](en\objects\Sprite.html). Instances of
[Object3D](en\core\Object3D.html), [Group](en\objects\Group.html) or
[Bone](en\objects\Bone.html) are not renderable and thus this callback is not
executed for such objects.

### parent

  
  
```ts  
parent: Object3D;  
```  

Object's parent in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph">scene graph</a>. An object
can have at most one parent.

### position

  
  
```ts  
position: Vector3;  
```  

A [Vector3](en\math\Vector3.html) representing the object's local position.
Default is `(0, 0, 0)`.

### quaternion

  
  
```ts  
quaternion: Quaternion;  
```  

Object's local rotation as a [Quaternion](en\math\Quaternion.html).

### receiveShadow

  
  
```ts  
receiveShadow: Boolean;  
```  

Whether the material receives shadows. Default is `false`.

### renderOrder

  
  
```ts  
renderOrder: Number;  
```  

This value allows the default rendering order of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph">scene graph</a> objects to be
overridden although opaque and transparent objects remain sorted
independently. When this property is set for an instance of
[Group](en\objects\Group.html), all descendants objects will be sorted and
rendered together. Sorting is from lowest to highest renderOrder. Default
value is `0`.

### rotation

  
  
```ts  
rotation: Euler;  
```  

Object's local rotation (see <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles">Euler angles</a>), in
radians.

### scale

  
  
```ts  
scale: Vector3;  
```  

The object's local scale. Default is [Vector3](en\math\Vector3.html)( 1, 1, 1
).

### up

  
  
```ts  
up: Vector3;  
```  

This is used by the [.lookAt](#lookAt) method, for example, to determine the
orientation of the result.  
Default is [Object3D.DEFAULT_UP](#) - that is, `( 0, 1, 0 )`.

### userData

  
  
```ts  
userData: Object;  
```  

An object that can be used to store custom data about the Object3D. It should
not hold references to functions as these will not be cloned.

### uuid

  
  
```ts  
uuid: String;  
```  

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID</a>
of this object instance. This gets automatically assigned, so this shouldn't
be edited.

### visible

  
  
```ts  
visible: Boolean;  
```  

Object gets rendered if `true`. Default is `true`.

## Static Properties

Static properties and methods are defined per class rather than per instance
of that class. This means that changing [Object3D.DEFAULT_UP](#) or
[Object3D.DEFAULT_MATRIX_AUTO_UPDATE](#) will change the values of [.up](#up)
and [.matrixAutoUpdate](#matrixAutoUpdate) for `every` instance of Object3D
(or derived classes) created after the change has been made (already created
Object3Ds will not be affected).

### DEFAULT_UP

  
  
```ts  
DEFAULT_UP: Vector3;  
```  

The default [.up](#up) direction for objects, also used as the default
position for [DirectionalLight](en\lights\DirectionalLight.html),
[HemisphereLight](en\lights\HemisphereLight.html) and [Spotlight](#) (which
creates lights shining from the top down).  
Set to ( 0, 1, 0 ) by default.

### DEFAULT_MATRIX_AUTO_UPDATE

  
  
```ts  
DEFAULT_MATRIX_AUTO_UPDATE: Boolean;  
```  

The default setting for [.matrixAutoUpdate](#matrixAutoUpdate) for newly
created Object3Ds.  

### DEFAULT_MATRIX_WORLD_AUTO_UPDATE

  
  
```ts  
DEFAULT_MATRIX_WORLD_AUTO_UPDATE: Boolean;  
```  

The default setting for [.matrixWorldAutoUpdate](#matrixWorldAutoUpdate) for
newly created Object3Ds.
