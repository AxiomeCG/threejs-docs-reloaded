# MeshStandardMaterial

A standard physically based material, using Metallic-Roughness workflow.  
  
Physically based rendering (PBR) has recently become the standard in many 3D
applications, such as <a
href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/10/29/physically-based-shading-in-
unity-5-a-primer/">Unity</a>, <a
href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/Materials/PhysicallyBased/">Unreal</a>
and <a href="http://area.autodesk.com/blogs/the-3ds-max-blog/what039s-new-for-
rendering-in-3ds-max-2017">3D Studio Max</a>.  
  
This approach differs from older approaches in that instead of using
approximations for the way in which light interacts with a surface, a
physically correct model is used. The idea is that, instead of tweaking
materials to look good under specific lighting, a material can be created that
will react 'correctly' under all lighting scenarios.  
  
In practice this gives a more accurate and realistic looking result than the
[MeshLambertMaterial](en\materials\MeshLambertMaterial.html) or
[MeshPhongMaterial](en\materials\MeshPhongMaterial.html), at the cost of being
somewhat more computationally expensive. MeshStandardMaterial uses per-
fragment shading.  
  
Note that for best results you should always specify an [.envMap](#envMap)
when using this material.

## Constructor

### MeshStandardMaterial

  
  
```ts  
function MeshStandardMaterial( parameters: Object ): void;  
```  

[parameters](#) - (optional) an object with one or more properties defining
the material's appearance. Any property of the material (including any
property inherited from [Material](en\materials\Material.html)) can be passed
in here.  
  
The exception is the property [color](#), which can be passed in as a
hexadecimal string and is `0xffffff` (white) by default. [Color.set](#)( color
) is called internally.

## Properties

See the base [Material](en\materials\Material.html) class for common
properties.

### alphaMap

  
  
```ts  
alphaMap: Texture;  
```  

The alpha map is a grayscale texture that controls the opacity across the
surface (black: fully transparent; white: fully opaque). Default is null.  
  
Only the color of the texture is used, ignoring the alpha channel if one
exists. For RGB and RGBA textures, the
[WebGL](en\renderers\WebGLRenderer.html) renderer will use the green channel
when sampling this texture due to the extra bit of precision provided for
green in DXT-compressed and uncompressed RGB 565 formats. Luminance-only and
luminance/alpha textures will also still work as expected.

### aoMap

  
  
```ts  
aoMap: Texture;  
```  

The red channel of this texture is used as the ambient occlusion map. Default
is null. The aoMap requires a second set of UVs.

### aoMapIntensity

  
  
```ts  
aoMapIntensity: Float;  
```  

Intensity of the ambient occlusion effect. Default is `1`. Zero is no
occlusion effect.

### bumpMap

  
  
```ts  
bumpMap: Texture;  
```  

The texture to create a bump map. The black and white values map to the
perceived depth in relation to the lights. Bump doesn't actually affect the
geometry of the object, only the lighting. If a normal map is defined this
will be ignored.

### bumpScale

  
  
```ts  
bumpScale: Float;  
```  

How much the bump map affects the material. Typical ranges are 0-1. Default is
`1`.

### color

  
  
```ts  
color: Color;  
```  

[Color](en\math\Color.html) of the material, by default set to white
(0xffffff).

### defines

  
  
```ts  
defines: Object;  
```  

An object of the form:  
```ts  
{ 'STANDARD': '' };  
```  
This is used by the [WebGLRenderer](en\renderers\WebGLRenderer.html) for
selecting shaders.

### displacementMap

  
  
```ts  
displacementMap: Texture;  
```  

The displacement map affects the position of the mesh's vertices. Unlike other
maps which only affect the light and shade of the material the displaced
vertices can cast shadows, block other objects, and otherwise act as real
geometry. The displacement texture is an image where the value of each pixel
(white being the highest) is mapped against, and repositions, the vertices of
the mesh.

### displacementScale

  
  
```ts  
displacementScale: Float;  
```  

How much the displacement map affects the mesh (where black is no
displacement, and white is maximum displacement). Without a displacement map
set, this value is not applied. Default is `1`.

### displacementBias

  
  
```ts  
displacementBias: Float;  
```  

The offset of the displacement map's values on the mesh's vertices. Without a
displacement map set, this value is not applied. Default is `0`.

### emissive

  
  
```ts  
emissive: Color;  
```  

Emissive (light) color of the material, essentially a solid color unaffected
by other lighting. Default is black.

### emissiveMap

  
  
```ts  
emissiveMap: Texture;  
```  

Set emissive (glow) map. Default is null. The emissive map color is modulated
by the emissive color and the emissive intensity. If you have an emissive map,
be sure to set the emissive color to something other than black.

### emissiveIntensity

  
  
```ts  
emissiveIntensity: Float;  
```  

Intensity of the emissive light. Modulates the emissive color. Default is 1.

### envMap

  
  
```ts  
envMap: Texture;  
```  

The environment map. To ensure a physically correct rendering, you should only
add environment maps which were preprocessed by
[PMREMGenerator](en\extras\PMREMGenerator.html). Default is null.

### envMapIntensity

  
  
```ts  
envMapIntensity: Float;  
```  

Scales the effect of the environment map by multiplying its color.

### flatShading

  
  
```ts  
flatShading: Boolean;  
```  

Define whether the material is rendered with flat shading. Default is false.

### fog

  
  
```ts  
fog: Boolean;  
```  

Whether the material is affected by fog. Default is `true`.

### isMeshStandardMaterial

  
  
```ts  
isMeshStandardMaterial: Boolean;  
```  

Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type MeshStandardMaterial.

### lightMap

  
  
```ts  
lightMap: Texture;  
```  

The light map. Default is null. The lightMap requires a second set of UVs.

### lightMapIntensity

  
  
```ts  
lightMapIntensity: Float;  
```  

Intensity of the baked light. Default is `1`.

### map

  
  
```ts  
map: Texture;  
```  

The color map. May optionally include an alpha channel, typically combined
with [.transparent](#) or [.alphaTest](#). Default is null. The texture map
color is modulated by the diffuse [.color](#).

### metalness

  
  
```ts  
metalness: Float;  
```  

How much the material is like a metal. Non-metallic materials such as wood or
stone use `0.0`, metallic use `1.0`, with nothing (usually) in between.
Default is `0.0`. A value between `0.0` and `1.0` could be used for a rusty
metal look. If metalnessMap is also provided, both values are multiplied.

### metalnessMap

  
  
```ts  
metalnessMap: Texture;  
```  

The blue channel of this texture is used to alter the metalness of the
material.

### normalMap

  
  
```ts  
normalMap: Texture;  
```  

The texture to create a normal map. The RGB values affect the surface normal
for each pixel fragment and change the way the color is lit. Normal maps do
not change the actual shape of the surface, only the lighting. In case the
material has a normal map authored using the left handed convention, the y
component of normalScale should be negated to compensate for the different
handedness.

### normalMapType

  
  
```ts  
normalMapType: Integer;  
```  

The type of normal map.  
  
Options are [THREE.TangentSpaceNormalMap](#) (default), and
[THREE.ObjectSpaceNormalMap](#).

### normalScale

  
  
```ts  
normalScale: Vector2;  
```  

How much the normal map affects the material. Typical ranges are 0-1. Default
is a [Vector2](en\math\Vector2.html) set to (1,1).

### roughness

  
  
```ts  
roughness: Float;  
```  

How rough the material appears. `0.0` means a smooth mirror reflection, `1.0`
means fully diffuse. Default is `1.0`. If roughnessMap is also provided, both
values are multiplied.

### roughnessMap

  
  
```ts  
roughnessMap: Texture;  
```  

The green channel of this texture is used to alter the roughness of the
material.

### wireframe

  
  
```ts  
wireframe: Boolean;  
```  

Render geometry as wireframe. Default is `false` (i.e. render as flat
polygons).

### wireframeLinecap

  
  
```ts  
wireframeLinecap: String;  
```  

Define appearance of line ends. Possible values are "butt", "round" and
"square". Default is 'round'.  
  
This corresponds to the <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineCap">2D
Canvas lineCap</a> property and it is ignored by the
[WebGL](en\renderers\WebGLRenderer.html) renderer.

### wireframeLinejoin

  
  
```ts  
wireframeLinejoin: String;  
```  

Define appearance of line joints. Possible values are "round", "bevel" and
"miter". Default is 'round'.  
  
This corresponds to the <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineJoin">2D
Canvas lineJoin</a> property and it is ignored by the
[WebGL](en\renderers\WebGLRenderer.html) renderer.

### wireframeLinewidth

  
  
```ts  
wireframeLinewidth: Float;  
```  

Controls wireframe thickness. Default is `1`.  
  
Due to limitations of the <a
href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.core.pdf">OpenGL
Core Profile</a> with the [WebGL](en\renderers\WebGLRenderer.html) renderer on
most platforms linewidth will always be `1` regardless of the set value.
